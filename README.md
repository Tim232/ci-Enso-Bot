The EnsōBot for the Ensō server on discord! 

A warm welcome from our small but growing community of Ensō.

Looking for a server that peaks your interests such as Art, Anime, Gaming/Streaming or simply hanging out with members? Then if so, this is a perfect community for you.

We are a sort of Indie/Aesthetic community, we all share our different interests in music or in many things we have in common, 
we respect all beliefs and/or orientations such as LGBTQ+ and more, 
we do NOT tolerate any sort of discrimination including Sexual/Racial/Religious, all members are treated equally. 
This is a chill community with awesome talented members, keep that in mind!

There are a variety of roles you are introduced to the more active you are on the server, in minimal occasions we host events or moderator applications, we strive to make our ambience better for each and every individual, so feel free to join in the fun in Ensō!
